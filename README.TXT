PROJECT TITLE: Project 2 - TaskKeeper

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The goals of this project are as follows:
    •Use custom data structures to store information.
    •Learn how to use a Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure to
	separate different parts of a program.
    •Break your code into organized components.
    •Begin to explore complex search algorithms by implementing
	complex logic operator functionality.
    •Learn how to make programs that work in real-time with data
	provided by the user.
      - Start thinking about how to account for user error in your
	code instead of throwing exceptions.

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
    •To run the unit-tests for the Model, generic LinkedList, and Task
        classes, compile the project and press the 'Run Tests' button
        on the BlueJ dashboard.
    •To run the TaskKeeper itself, right-click the Controller class
        on the BlueJ dashboard and run the void main(String[] args)
        method. Or, compile the project and run the Controller class
        from the commandline.
      - The file 'save.csv' contains a few example tasks that can be
	used for user testing.
    •The 'test.csv' file should not be modified, as it is used for
	unit-testing the Model class.
